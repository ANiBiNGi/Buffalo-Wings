Breaking down chicken wings is easy-peasy. Grab a sharp chef’s knife, feel for the joint and firmly sink your knife right in the middle and it should go in pretty darn easily, separating one wing into thirds. Discard the wing tips or save, freeze and use in stock. But you only want the drumettes and wingettes.

You might have to work in batches depending on how much chicken wings you’re cooking (I’m using 4 to 5 pounds), but that’s okay. Preheat your oven to 425° and line a rimmed sheet pan with non-stick foil. Brush the aluminum foil with oil (to reinforce the non-stick part), then toss the wings in 3 tablespoons of olive oil before lining them up on the foil.

Slide them on the middle rack of your preheated oven and bake for minutes before rotating the pan halfway and baking for 15 more minutes. Then turn on the broiler until crispy and golden.

While the chicken is under the broiler, make the sauce. You’ll need a full cup of Frank’s Red Hot hot sauce. I should buy Frank’s by the barrel because we go through it like people go through a loaf of bread. And by “we” I mean my husband and my oldest daughter Haileigh. Both of them put it on burgers, popcorn, chicken tenders, tacos — and the list goes on. I like it on this and of course in this spicy garlic sauce.

Add the Franks to a small sauce pan. Then grate in a whole (medium-size) clove of garlic. Lastly, measure and add in the sugar, black pepper, cayenne and Worcestershire.

Give it a whisk and bring it up to a simmer. Let it bubble on low while whisking every so often, and once hot and bubbly remove it off of the burner.

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolk, 2 teaspoons of both water and cornstarch. This will thicken the wing sauce up perfectly.

Once the yolk and cornstarch are mixed, pour only a little of the warm sauce into the egg mixture while whisking.

Slowly, and I mean S-L-O-W-L-Y drizzle in the warm hot sauce mixture while whisking like a crazy person. This is called “tempering” which basically means to bring the temperature of the egg mixture up closer to the temperature of the hotter ingredients. And by going slow and whisking fast it will prevent the egg from “scrambling”. After you’ve added the little bit of sauce, go ahead and gradually add in the rest of the sauce, still whisking.

Remove the wings once they are deep golden brown and skin is crispy. Then toss the wings into the bowl with the spicy garlic sauce…

…and toss. Try not to take any deep breathes while your tossing the wings as you may choke on the fumes.

Not even kidding.

Serve these spicy garlic chicken wings with the best ranch dip and prepare yourself for becoming a saucy mess.

That is all of the amazing buffalo/chicken wings recipe!
